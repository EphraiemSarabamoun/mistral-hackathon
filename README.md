# Prisme

**See your writing through every perspective.**

Prisme is an AI-powered writing tool that helps journalists and writers understand how their articles land with different audiences before they publish. Write in a rich text editor, then get instant feedback from three ideologically distinct AI agents, each powered by [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).

Built for the **Mistral AI Hackathon** by **Team Bonaparte**.

## The Problem

Every article carries blind spots. A journalist may unintentionally favor one perspective, miss critical context, or use framing that alienates part of their audience. Traditional editing catches grammar not bias.

## The Solution

Prisme puts three AI "lenses" on your writing simultaneously:

Each agent scores your article (1–10), flags disagreements, and can **suggest targeted edits** that appear as an interactive diff you can accept or reject. You can also calibrate your agents by uploading folders of articles and batch-testing them to see how each agent scores across a corpus, then tweak agent personas and descriptions until they behave exactly how you want.


## Powered by Mistral

Prisme uses **Mistral Large** (`mistral-large-latest`) exclusively for all AI features:

- **Feedback generation**:  Each agent evaluates articles from their ideological perspective, returning structured JSON (approval score, disagreements, perspective summary)
- **Improvement suggestions**: Agents propose minimal, targeted edits to improve how the article reads from their viewpoint
- **Batch evaluation**: Run all agents against entire article folders for calibration
- **JSON mode**: Guaranteed structured output via Mistral's `responseFormat: { type: "json_object" }`
